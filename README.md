# Royal Mail tracking script :postbox:

I recently found myself sending a few packages using Royal Mail (a postal service in Britain), and thought a script to automatically check the status of my package would be a good excuse to use `puppeteer`. 

:heavy_exclamation_mark:**Note**: Automating is one thing, but making too many requests to `royalmail.com` is another. My intention is not to abuse the great service they provide, but just to take the leg-work out of looking up my tracking code multiple times a day.

## Setup & Usage :gear:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nkhil/royalmail-track-package-script.git
npm install
cd royalmail-track-package-script
# WIP - coming soon!
```

## The script :pencil:

// Coming soon!
