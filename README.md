# Royal Mail tracking script

Recently I found myself sending a few packages using Royal Mail (a postal service in Britain), and thought a script to automatically check the status of my package would be a good excuse to use `puppeteer`. 

## Setup & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nkhil/royalmail-track-package-script.git
npm install
cd royalmail-track-package-script
# WIP - coming soon!
```

## The script

```javascript
// Coming soon!
```
